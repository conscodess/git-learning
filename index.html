<h2> Biography </h2>
<div class= "bio-head">
<div class="bio-box">
<p> I was born in the sunny town of Acapulco in Mexico, July 14, 2005. I lived there up until the age of six, when I moved to San Antonio, TX. I really enjoyed my time there, and after a couple of years I returned to Mexico City where I finished high school. 
  Last year, I moved to Madrid, Spain to study a bachelor's in Economics and Finance at Universidad Francisco de Vitoria. I totally love the culture and the people!
